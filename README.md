# Pixel Silhouette

This tool turns your color images into clean, black-and-white icons.

-----

### How it Works

1.  **Upload your image:** Choose a PNG or JPG file.
      * **Note:** Your image's subject should be **darker than its background**. This tool works by removing lighter background pixels.
2.  **Crop it:** Frame your subject precisely. You can switch between different themes to help you see transparent areas better while cropping.
3.  **Adjust settings:**
      * **Background Tolerance:** This is a crucial setting\! Increase it to remove more light background pixels, or decrease it to preserve more light details in your subject. Adjust this slider until you get a perfect black silhouette on a pure white background.
      * Set your desired **canvas size** and the **maximum size** for your icon within that canvas.
4.  **Download:** Save your new black-and-white icon\!
